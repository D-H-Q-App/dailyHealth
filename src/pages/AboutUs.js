        <p>Since I was 14, I’ve always been fascinated with health, biology, and epigenetics. I was a Nutrition minor in college and I continued learning and studying other cultures approaches to Nurtrition and Health.I struggled with many health issues including such severe allergies that I used to get five to six sinus infections a year. </p>

        <p>I tried all sorts of different diets and lifestyle practices. I decided to eat primarily vegan. That helped a lot. Then I got really into the raw vegan and digest enzyme craze. Although my sinus infections and allergies were gone, I was getting really bad puffiness and dark circles under my eyes to a point where I looked like I was dying, no joke. </p>

        <p>As an actor on camera, I started really worrying about my appearance and was seriously considering getting expensive plastic surgeries. I also couldn’t eat sugar, not even fruit, without my blood sugar spiking. I couldn’t eat much of anything without it aggravating the bags under my eyes and digestion. I was bloated, tired, depressed, and lethargic.  I knew something wasn’t right. I was eating “so well.” What was going on? I went to see a few Western doctors and nutritionists and they all said, “That’s just what happens when you get older.” However, if it was “old age,” why would the issues come and go? I decided to seek Eastern medicine. I started seeing an Ayurvedic Practitioner once a month. Within a few months of implementing the food choices and lifestyle practices she suggested for my mind-body constitution, along with prescribed Ayurvedic herbal medicines, the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes diminished and I could eat wholesome sweets without having blood sugar spikes. I was also way more productive and happier!</p>

        <p>I was so amazed by how joyful, healthy, whole, and balanced I felt that I decided as Software Engineer to bring a web application to help bring more health to others. My self education has given me the in-depth the tool to help guide you in your journey of reclaiming your health and living a more balanced and happier life.</p>

        <p>If this sounds like something you would like to accomplish, take this quiz as often as you like and if you're interested in working with an Ayurvedic Practitioner I highly suggest Julie Bernier https://www.trueayurveda.com/ayurvedic-consultations/ or any of the practioners or doctors at Kerala. https://www.keralaayurveda.us/wellnesscenter/natural-healing-and-prakriti-your-ayurvedic-constitution/  Let’s get started living your happiest and healthiest life.</p>
